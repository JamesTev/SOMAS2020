//	+ EX: if island 1 gets hit the most then cp will help island 1 more than the rest 

//	+ There is a threshold T that incentivizes contributing to the cp from islands
//	+ If threshold T is met, which mean islands have prepared well before the disaster hit, the damage that disaster have on cp and islands will be half 
//	+ If not, cp and islands will feel the full effect of disaster
//	+ For now, each 1 effect of disaster is equivalent to 1000 resource
